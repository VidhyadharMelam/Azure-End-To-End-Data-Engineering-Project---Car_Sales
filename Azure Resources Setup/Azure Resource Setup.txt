Azure Resources Setup:

Goal:

A step-by-step guide to setting up the necessary Azure resources required for the end-to-end data engineering pipeline. These resources include storage, compute, and orchestration services.

Step 1: Create an Azure Resource Group

	A resource group is required to organize all Azure resources for this project.

	Navigate to the Azure Portal.

	Search for Resource Groups and click Create.

	Provide a name (e.g., car-sales-rg) and choose a region.

	Click Review + Create and then Create.

Step 2: Set Up Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

	Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2) is used to store raw, transformed, and aggregated data.

	Go to the Azure Portal and search for Storage Accounts.

	Click Create, select the previously created resource group.

	Choose a Storage Account Name (e.g., carsalesdatalake).

	Select Region, Standard performance, and StorageV2.

	Enable Hierarchical Namespace for optimized querying.

	Click Review + Create and then Create.

Step 3: Set Up Azure Data Factory (ADF)

	ADF is used for orchestrating data ingestion.

	Search for Data Factory in the Azure Portal.

	Click Create and provide a name (e.g., car-sales-adf).

	Select the Resource Group created earlier.

	Choose Region and Git Integration (if applicable).

	Click Review + Create and then Create.

Step 4: Configure Azure Databricks Workspace

	Azure Databricks is used for data transformation and analytics.

	Go to the Azure Portal and search for Azure Databricks.

	Click Create, choose the Resource Group.

	Provide a workspace name (e.g., car-sales-databricks).

	Choose Pricing Tier (Standard or Premium depending on requirements).

	Click Review + Create and then Create.

	Databricks Cluster Configuration

	Open Azure Databricks Workspace.

	Navigate to Compute and click Create Cluster.

	Choose a Cluster Name (e.g., car-sales-cluster).

	Select Databricks Runtime Version (Latest LTS recommended).

	Configure Autoscaling and set Min/Max Workers.

	Click Create.

Step 5: Enable Unity Catalog for Data Governance

	Open Azure Databricks Workspace.

	Navigate to Settings > Admin Console.

	Enable Unity Catalog and set up required access controls.

Step 6: Configure Security & Access

	Assign Storage Blob Data Contributor role to Databricks for access to ADLS Gen2.

	Use Managed Identities to connect ADF securely to storage and databases.

Step 7: Create Azure SQL Database (Optional for Source Data)

	Search for Azure SQL Database in the Azure Portal.

	Click Create, provide a Database Name (e.g., car-sales-db).

	Configure Compute & Storage as per requirements.

	Set up firewall rules for secure access.

	Click Review + Create and then Create.
