PySpark Data Transformation in Databricks:

Goal:

This document details how raw data is transformed using PySpark in Azure Databricks, ensuring data quality, consistency, and optimization for analytical processing.

Transformation Process:

Data transformation occurs in multiple stages within the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers):

1. Bronze Layer (Raw Data Cleansing)

	Remove Duplicates: Identify and drop duplicate records.

	Handle Missing Values: Impute or remove NULL values where necessary.

	Standardize Formats: Convert date formats, normalize text fields, and standardize categorical values.

2. Silver Layer (Data Enrichment & Processing)

	Joins & Relationships: Combine data from multiple tables (e.g., linking sales data to dealer and branch details).

	Aggregation & Derived Metrics: Calculate revenue, total units sold, and other business KPIs.

	Data Type Casting: Convert data types for performance optimization (e.g., string to integer, timestamp conversions).

	Apply Business Logic: Implement business-specific rules for data transformation.

	Store in Parquet Format: Save transformed data in an optimized, compressed format for further processing.

3. Gold Layer (Star Schema & Delta Lake Storage)

	Fact and Dimension Tables: Transform data into a star schema with a central fact table and multiple dimension tables.

	Surrogate Key Generation: Replace natural keys with surrogate keys for efficient joins.

	Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD Type 1): Ensure dimension updates reflect the latest information.

	Store in Delta Lake Format: Optimized for ACID transactions and fast querying.


Key Benefits of PySpark Transformations

	Scalability: Handles large volumes of data efficiently.

	Performance Optimization: Parquet and Delta Lake formats improve read/write speeds.

	Data Quality: Cleansing, enrichment, and validation ensure high data accuracy.

	Automation: Integrated into Databricks workflows for end-to-end automation.
